# moneysense
Fell in love with personal finance and one of the principals I learned was, "You can't grow what you don't track." So welcome to my attempt in creating a income and expense full stack web application.

Current Tech stack:
- Database : MongoDB
- Glue : Express
- Frontend : React
- Backend : Node.js


UPDATE (10/11/23):
Any documentation for Cents

Formally named MoneySense name changed to Cents {like sense, common sense}.

Github repo: https://github.com/erickkahinga/moneysense

This documentation is for important tracking information.

Timeline for website to be live is TBH however feel free to explore what I have completed thus far by running “npm start” in the backend {cd into backend folder first}.

Majority of my time has been spent working on the backend:
Creating a proper database to hold user data in a fast and reliable way.
I chose to use MongoDB’s api for this case because the relational database features allow for more freedom in creating the specific type of relationships I wanted to hold in my database.
I know it is not as fast as SQL databases but this is a small sacrifice for not having to write complicated queries to get the information I desire.
Using Express to expose the backend. I Created custom api endpoints which I am currently testing on Postman.
Using Node.js as my backend. Npm offers many useful packages that I am familiar with. Django is an awesome tool. I was just more familiar with Node.


The frontend is not up to speed but I do have an outline of what the frontend should look like. Utilizing React to create the frontend. Frontend priorities are:
Responsive and fast
Looks cool
User friendly
I was looking into different solutions to achieve these priorities, such as Next.js with its server-rendering capabilities however I am still looking at solutions.
